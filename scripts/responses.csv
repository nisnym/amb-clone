"  The	chase	was	on.	In	short	order,	I	built	a	world-class	team—recruiting	talent	out	of	companies	like
Stripe,	 Yelp,	 and	 Amazon—and	 together	 we	 went	 to	 work	 on	 building	 a	 world-class	 product.	 I	 was
confident	that	I’d	soon	be	strolling	through	Allen	&	Company’s	annual	Sun	Valley	conference,	strategizing
about	the	fight	against	malaria	arm-in-arm	with	Bill	Gates	and	Warren	Buffett.	I	was	never	in	it	for	the

be	the	kind	of	titan	magazine	profiles	called	“down-to-earth.”
  I	didn’t	make	it	to	Sun	Valley	that	summer.	Or	the	summer	after	that.	The	closest	I	ever	got	to	Bill	Gates
was	watching	him	speak	at	a	Kleiner	Perkins	CEO	summit.	Gumroad’s	pitched	flight	into	the	stratosphere

"  Once	the	bleeding	stopped,	it	was	time	to	reassess.	Gumroad	was	still	operational,	but	I	felt	like	a
complete	failure.	With	many	in	my	circle	still	focused	on	raising	money,	hiring	employees,	and	chasing
their	own	billion-dollar	companies—some	successfully—I	couldn’t	bear	to	stick	around	Silicon	Valley.	For
much	of	2016,	I	kept	my	apartment	in	San	Francisco	but	spent	most	of	my	time	traveling	and	writing
fiction,	convinced	that	even	if	I	couldn’t	hack	it	in	Startupland,	I	could	still	build	a	life	for	myself	as	a
digital	nomad.	While	I	was	inspired	by	Tim	Ferriss’s	The	4-Hour	Workweek,	it	didn’t	take	long	to	realize
that	operating	Gumroad	as	a	lifestyle	business	wasn’t	for	me.	I	was	still	trying	to	figure	out	what	came
next	when	I	saw	a	tweet	from	Brandon	Sanderson,	one	of	my	favorite	authors,	about	a	science-fiction	and
fantasy	writing	class	he	was	teaching	in	Provo,	Utah.	In	January	2017,	I	jumped	on	the	opportunity	to
save	rent	and	save	face	by	moving	to	a	place	where	no	one	knew	me.	There,	I	could	figure	out	how	to
regroup	even	as	I	kept	Gumroad	afloat.
